          I remember when I was young going to the footy with my mates When
          Carlton played at the 'G' we stop at the Duke of Wellington pub before
          and after the game. Anyway, late one night after the game I walked up
          to the bar, There was a younger guy (no more than 19) ordering in
          front of me. He asked for a rum and coke and a raspberry and vodka. He
          was being served by the owner. The barman (owner) said, "This isn't a
          ###g chemist shop you ####!" Hilarious
